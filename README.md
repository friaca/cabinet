# Cabinet

A dead simple inventory manager.

This README and code is in English but the UI itself is in Portuguese for now. In the future I'll apply i18n but in the meantime it'll continue in Portuguese.

Most of the functionality is working, but I'm still adjusting and adding a few things. 

Right now it supports products, locations, transactions and associating said products with said locations. 

## Running

The same as usual with most Elixir codebases:

```mix setup```
```mix phx.server```

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or contribute to the code. The code may not be the most idiomatic, I'm still kinda new to Elixir, this is my first big boy project in it.
